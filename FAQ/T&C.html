                                    We do not accept responsibility or liability for any mistakes in respect of the announcing, publishing or marking of prices, handicaps, place terms, betting information or results despite our every effort to ensure accuracy. We make every effort to ensure that no errors are made in prices offered or bets accepted. However, human and/or systems’ error may occasionally result in errors. We reserve the right to correct any obvious error and to void any bet placed where such have occurred. In the case of any blatant errors in prices transmitted (including for example where the price being displayed is materially different from those available in the general market and/or the price is clearly incorrect, depending on all of the circumstances), bets will be settled at the correct price at the time of acceptance. If a bet is accepted by us on an event where offering a price on the event itself (rather than the price) was in error, the bet will be void and your stake will be returned.<br><br>
                                    Should funds be credited to a customer’s Account in error, it is the customer’s responsibility to notify us of the error without delay. Any winnings subsequent to the error and prior to notification to us, whether linked to the error or not, shall be deemed invalid and returned to, or otherwise be reclaimable by, us.
